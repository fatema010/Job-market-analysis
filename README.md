Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview
Created a tool that estimates data science salaries to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
Scraped about 100 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.


Code and Resources Used:
Python Version: 3.9.13
Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, selenium, pickle


Web Scraping
With each job, we got the following:

Job title
Salary Estimate
Job Description
Rating
Company
Location
Company Headquarters
Company Size
Company Founded Date
Type of Ownership
Industry
Sector
Revenue


Data Cleaning
After scraping the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

Parsed numeric data out of salary
Made columns for employer provided salary and hourly wages
Removed rows without salary
Parsed rating out of company text
Made a new column for company state
Added a column for if the job was at the companyâ€™s headquarters
Made columns for if different skills were listed in the job description:
Python
R
Excel
AWS
Spark
Column for simplified job title and Seniority
Column for description length
